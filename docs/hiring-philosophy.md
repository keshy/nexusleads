# Hiring Philosophy: AI-First Engineers

## Purpose
We hire engineers who can use AI as a force multiplier to build production-grade software quickly without sacrificing rigor. The goal is not just speed, but speed with correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## Definition: AI-First Engineer
An AI-first engineer treats AI as a partner in reasoning, execution, and verification. They are not prompt-dependent. They frame problems, set constraints, verify outputs, and own the end-to-end outcome.

## Core Principles
- AI is an amplifier, not a substitute. We expect engineers to use AI to move faster while maintaining responsibility for correctness.
- Speed with rigor beats speed alone. We value fast iteration that still includes testing, observability, and production readiness.
- Start right. We optimize for good initial direction through clear problem framing, constraints, and validation.
- Systems thinking over isolated solutions. We favor engineers who consider reliability, security, scalability, and cost early.
- Evals and data are first-class. If a system depends on AI or data, evaluation and monitoring are required, not optional.
- Communication is a technical skill. Great engineers can explain intent, tradeoffs, and risk to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Ownership is end-to-end. We hire people who see through from idea to deployment to operational excellence.

## What We Look For
- Strong problem framing with explicit constraints and success criteria.
- Relentless iteration with AI and a critical eye for errors and edge cases.
- Balanced engineering judgment across product, data, infra, and reliability.
- Clear, structured communication and the ability to teach while building.
- Ability to independently choose tools and justify tradeoffs.

## Anti-Patterns We Avoid
- Prompt-only dependency with little verification or critical reasoning.
- Shallow velocity that ignores testing, observability, and reliability.
- Over-design or paralysis instead of strong initial direction and iterative refinement.
- Poor communication, ambiguous decisions, or lack of ownership.

## Hiring Bar
We only hire candidates who can demonstrate both high leverage with AI and durable engineering fundamentals. The bar increases as AI reduces the cost of building; our hires must show they can do more, not just do it faster.

## What Success Looks Like in the First 90 Days
- Ships a meaningful feature using AI to accelerate but not compromise quality.
- Defines and implements a realistic evaluation plan when AI or data is involved.
- Improves system reliability or developer velocity through tooling or process changes.
- Communicates progress, tradeoffs, and risks with clarity and credibility.
